# Doc-QA-with-expert

This is a program which enables you to chat with your document and ask it questions which it will answer according to the context in the document.

When a question is asked, an expert is assigned based on the question.
For example- If supposingly you have uploaded a pitch deck and you ask the 'What is the market area for this product?', then the program will take the role of a Market Analyst (or some other related expert) and answer the question accordingly.

This app is mainly made using Streamlit, Langchain and OpenAI
